# Known Issues

The working list of known bugs in the recomp, what's being done about each one,
and where the fix lives. Player-facing bugs also get a line under "Known
issues" in the [README](README.md#native-renderer). That line comes out once
the fix ships.

## How to use this file

- Each issue gets the next free `KI-N` id. Ids are never reused.
- **Status** is one of `open`, `investigating`, `fix in review`, `fixed`
  (merged and confirmed in-game), `won't fix`, or `could not reproduce`.
- **Tracking** lists the PRs, GitHub issues and sessions working on it.
- Fixed issues move to [Resolved](#resolved) with the PR that fixed them. The
  repro and cause notes stay there for when a regression turns up.
- A PR that fixes an issue names its id (for example `Fixes KI-16`) and updates
  its entry in the same change.
- Name locations by file and function, not line numbers; line numbers drift.
- For rendering bugs, always say whether the emulated renderer (F5) shows the
  same problem. A bug that only shows on the native renderer is a native
  renderer bug.

Capture recipe for native renderer bugs: launch with
`--skate3_native_render_capture_hotkeys=true`, switch to the native renderer
with F6, toggle F5/F6 to compare with the emulated renderer, then press F10.
That dumps the draws and a full guest-memory `.gsnap` into
`<cwd>/native_render_snapshots`.

### Code review findings (KI-8 to KI-33)

KI-8 to KI-33 come from a full code review in October 2026. They were first
tracked as `BT-01` to `BT-26` in `docs/bug-tracker.md`, which this file
replaces; the KI id is the BT number plus 7 (BT-09 is KI-16). PR #19 and the
commits from #17 and #19 still use the BT ids. Most of these are code-level
risks found by reading the code, not bugs reported from play, so they have no
repro steps; the entry says where the problem is and how it would show.

**Severity** (code review entries only):
- **medium:** wrong output, stuck state or memory safety in normal play.
- **low–medium:** slow leaks, debug-only memory hazards, or features that
  silently stop working.
- **low:** cleanup, edge cases, cosmetic.

## Open

### KI-3: Park editor warehouses render wrong on the native renderer

- **Status:** open
- **Area:** native renderer, park editor
- **Tracking:** none yet
- **Symptom:** skate parks and park editing have visual parity problems on the
  native renderer. The clearest case is the park-editor warehouse interiors.
  This is the README's remaining "Skate parks and park editing" known issue.
- **Cause so far:** the warehouse interior environment shader never passes the
  world-row capture gate, so the native path never captures it as world
  geometry.
- **Next step:** take an F10 capture inside a park-editor warehouse to see what
  the interior draws look like and why the gate rejects them.

### KI-6: Tattoos don't show on the player character

- **Status:** open
- **Area:** emulation (both renderers), character customization
- **Tracking:** none yet
- **Symptom:** tattoos added in Edit Skater don't appear on the skater. This
  happens on the emulated renderer (F5) as well as the native one. Split out
  of KI-4.
- **Cause so far:** unknown. Since the emulated renderer is wrong too, the
  native port isn't missing anything here. The native renderer already follows
  the game's tattoo path (`cacstamp_skin` samples `i_decal` at tf6 through the
  `i_customGraphic` affine, c190/c191). A fix earlier in the pipeline should
  show on both renderers.
- **Next step:** take an F10 capture in Edit Skater with a tattoo applied.
  Check what the `cacstamp_skin` draw binds at tf6 (a blank or default
  texture, or the real art) and the values in c190/c191. A blank tf6 means the
  tattoo never reaches the texture. The texture-space composite pass may be
  suppressed or failing, its resolve may be lost, or the recomp may break a
  CPU-side step.

### KI-16: Upload rings reused without a GPU completion check

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium · was BT-09
- **Area:** native renderer, GPU uploads
- **Where:** `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`, `src/skate3_native_scene_post.cpp`
- **Problem:** several upload and constant rings pick their slot with
  `frame_number % N`: the UI ring, the shadow constant buffer, the bone ring,
  the photo FX CB slots (`% 4`) and the screen FX CB. None checks that the GPU
  has finished with the slot. The comment above the ring sizes in
  `skate3_native_scene_gpu_internal.h` notes that a slot was observed being
  recycled while still in use. It would show as one-frame corruption of HUD,
  bones or constants when the GPU falls behind.
- **Fix idea:** gate each slot on `CompletedSubmission()`, or size the rings
  from the device's frames in flight.

### KI-18: Draw-distance slots never freed; LOD distances scaled in place

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium · was BT-11
- **Area:** draw distance
- **Where:** `src/skate3_draw_distance.cpp`
- **Problem:** the 16 fixed cull-threshold slots are never freed, so
  draw-distance scaling silently stops once enough cull objects have been
  seen. LOD distances are multiplied in place every frame, which relies on the
  game rewriting them each frame.

### KI-19: DLC and recipe directory scans can throw at startup

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium · was BT-12
- **Area:** app startup
- **Where:** `src/skate3_app_common.cpp`
- **Problem:** the DLC and recipe scans use the non-throwing iterator
  constructor, but `operator++` can still throw (for example on a permissions
  error partway through a folder), which would end startup with an exception.
- **Fix:** step with `increment(ec)`.

### KI-20: Depth-view caches compare textures by pointer

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium · was BT-13
- **Area:** native renderer, post effects
- **Where:** `s_pfx_depth_tex` (photo FX in `RenderScene`), and
  `ao_depth_srv_of`, `ssr_depth_srv_of`, `vol_depth_srv_of`
  (`src/skate3_native_scene_post.cpp`)
- **Problem:** a rebuilt depth texture is detected by comparing pointers. A
  texture freed and reallocated at the same address keeps the old view,
  possibly with the wrong MSAA dimension. The photo FX one is most exposed
  because it can sit idle across several rebuilds (for example MSAA changes
  while the photo editor is closed).
- **Fix idea:** a generation counter bumped on every depth rebuild.

### KI-21: Occlusion culling silently inactive with SSAO off

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium · was BT-14
- **Area:** native renderer, performance
- **Problem:** the occlusion grid is only produced inside `ApplySsaoPass`.
  With SSAO off, the grid expires after 240 frames and the occlusion cull
  stays off without any message.

### KI-22: Shadow-dump readback buffers not resized (debug only)

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium · was BT-15
- **Area:** native renderer, diagnostics
- **Where:** `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`
- **Problem:** the shadow-dump readback buffers keep their first size after a
  shadow tile change, so a later recording copies out of bounds on the GPU.

### KI-24: XUID parsing and TOML escaping in user settings

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low · was BT-17
- **Where:** `src/skate3_user_settings.cpp`
- **Problem:** `ParseXuidString` tries hex first, so it misreads decimal
  XUIDs. `TomlString` doesn't escape control characters.

### KI-25: Vehicle retention frustum test ignores the ultrawide scale

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low · was BT-18
- **Where:** `src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`
- **Problem:** the vehicle retention test omits `wide_hor_scale`, unlike the
  static retention test, so on ultrawide outputs vehicles at the screen edges
  can drop out of retention too early.

### KI-26: ProcessPrewarmEntry does an unguarded read on a worker

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low · was BT-19
- **Where:** `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`
- **Problem:** it does a guarded copy into `record` that is never used, then a
  raw `REX_LOAD` on the worker thread.

### KI-27: DecodeMesh input validation

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low · was BT-20
- **Problem:** element offsets aren't checked against the vertex stride (a
  host over-read on a malformed declaration), and several `Map()` results
  aren't checked for null.

### KI-29: Icon updater leaves `.icon-new` behind

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low · was BT-22
- **Where:** `src/skate3_win_icon.cpp`
- **Problem:** a failed swap leaves the `.icon-new` file in place.

### KI-37: Dead code for building without Title Update 3

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** build, codegen
- **Tracking:** none yet. Follow-up to KI-33 (#27).
- **Problem:** since #27, configure fails without TU3 codegen, so
  `SKATE3_HAS_TITLE_UPDATE_CODEGEN` and `SKATE3_HAS_TITLE_UPDATE` are always
  on. Everything behind the off branch is dead:
  - `CMakeLists.txt`: the default `SKATE3_FUNCTION_CONFIG_INCLUDES` pointing at
    `config/skate3_functions.toml`, the `if(SKATE3_HAS_TITLE_UPDATE_CODEGEN)`
    wrappers, and the `=0` branch of the compile definition.
  - `config/skate3_functions.toml`: the retail-only function boundaries.
    Nothing reads it any more.
  - `src/exception_compat.cpp`: the `#else` branch (the retail guard
    `sub_82F44E40` and its trampoline).
  - `src/skate3_app_common.cpp`: the `#if !SKATE3_HAS_TITLE_UPDATE`
    `Sub82EBAE4CImpl` and its `SetFunction(0x82EBAE4C)` registration, the
    non-TU `#else` of the macOS ISO-install chain, and the always-true guard
    around the title update installer check.
  - `src/skate3_guest_heap_diag.cpp`: the `#else` stub of
    `Skate3GuestHeapCategoryFreeBytes`.
  - `src/skate3_options_menu.cpp`: the always-true `SKATE3_HAS_TITLE_UPDATE`
    guards and any `#else` stubs paired with them.
  - The static_asserts #27 added to the hook blocks can go if the macro itself
    is removed. Keep them if it stays.
- **Fix:** delete the dead branches. Behaviour in TU3 builds doesn't change.
  Test with configure + build, then the unattended `--skate3_demo_path=true`
  boot.

### KI-36: Event-start 2D draws with a 32-byte vertex layout are dropped

- **Status:** open
- **Area:** HUD / UI, events (native renderer)
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-34 (#25).
- **Symptom:** none seen in play yet. The logs show that at the start of an Own
  the Lot event some 2D draws are never drawn on the native renderer, so an
  intro or banner element may be missing.
- **Evidence:** temporary per-second 2D stream stats (not committed) logged
  draws with a 32-byte vertex stride as quad lists (prim 13) in the
  event-start window: 64 in one second and 83 the next. `g_draws_2d_other`
  rose from 0 to 147 at the same time. A free-roam run showed other bursts in
  `g_draws_2d_other` (+240, +176), but their stride wasn't logged.
- **Cause so far:** `Publish2dDraws` (`skate3_native_scene.cpp`) handles only
  16, 20, 24 and 28-byte vertex layouts. Any other stride is counted in
  `g_draws_2d_other` and dropped. The 32-byte layout isn't decoded yet; it
  could be pos4 + color + uv + one more field, or pos4 + uv + uv2.
- **Emulated (F5):** not checked.
- **Next step:** take an F10 capture right at event start. The `.draws.bin`
  records the 2D draws with their inline vertex data. Decode the 32-byte
  vertices, compare with F5, then add the layout to `Publish2dDraws`.

### KI-39: The native RHI has no way to wait on a GPU submission

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** SDK native RHI
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-16 (#28).
- **Where:** rexglue-sdk `include/rex/graphics/native_rhi.h`. `nrhi::Device`
  has `CurrentSubmission()` and `CompletedSubmission()` but nothing that
  blocks.
- **Problem:** game code can't wait for the GPU. `CompletedSubmission()` is a
  cached value the command processor refreshes in `BeginSubmission`, so
  spinning on it on the render thread never advances. #28 therefore reuses
  the oldest region and logs, instead of waiting.
- **Next step:** add `Device::WaitForSubmission(uint64_t)`, backed by
  `CheckSubmissionFence` / `CheckSubmissionFenceAndDeviceLoss`. That needs an
  SDK-fork PR plus an "sdk: bump" commit. `UploadRingRegions::Acquire` can
  then wait, with a rate-limited log, instead of racing.
- **Lower priority (from KI-38, #49):** frames in flight never exceed 3 on
  either backend, even when GPU-bound. With #28's 8 regions, the fallback
  that would need this wait can't trigger in normal operation.

### KI-40: Photo FX constant slots have no bounds check

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, photo FX
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-16 (#28).
- **Where:** `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`, `RenderScene`, the photo FX
  `fill_cb` lambda.
- **Problem:** `cb_slot_next++` is never checked against
  `RendererState::kPfxCbSlots` (10). Today at most 10 slots are used: depth
  pack, accum feed, 6 passes, accum mode 2 and the debug view. One more pass
  would silently write into the next frame's region, or past the end of the
  buffer for the last region.
- **Fix:** clamp it, or assert and log when `cb_slot_next` reaches
  `kPfxCbSlots`.

### KI-41: Shadow-pass textures can be evicted while still in use

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** native renderer, shadows, texture cache
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-17 (#29).
- **Where:** `LookupResolvedTexture` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`,
  called by `RenderShadowAtlas` for alpha-clip casters (`item.dynobj == 2`).
  It is also called by `RenderStaticSunMap` for phase-1 `rec.diffuse_tex`,
  but that pass is experimental since KI-5.
- **Problem:** it reads the `tex_store` entry but never stamps its
  `last_used_frame`. `EvictTexStore` picks eviction candidates by
  `last_used_frame` alone, with a 5 s idle guard under byte pressure. A
  texture used only by the shadow passes, such as an off-screen or culled
  caster, looks idle and can be evicted. The caster passes never enqueue a
  decode, so it stays gone until the main pass draws that item again.
- **How it would show:** under texture-memory pressure, alpha-tested shadows
  (foliage, fences) become solid shapes for casters outside the view.
- **Evidence:** code reading only, not reproduced. #29 stamps the route in
  that function but deliberately leaves the store entry alone.
- **Next step:** after #29 lands, also set
  `sit->second.last_used_frame = frame_number` there (#29 passes
  `frame_number` in). Test with a small
  `skate3_native_render_scene_tex_store_mb` near foliage and compare shadow
  shapes with F5.

### KI-42: Perf log line repeats the texture count

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, diagnostics
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-17 (#29).
- **Where:** `LogFrameStats` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`, the
  `native-scene: frame N ...` line.
- **Problem:** `g_r.tex_store.size()` is logged three times: as
  `2d[... textures=]`, as `textures=` and as `store[n=]`. The 2D
  `textures=` field looks like a leftover from a separate 2D cache that no
  longer exists, so it misleads.
- **Fix:** drop the 2D `textures=` field, or make it count something
  2D-specific.

### KI-43: A script/debug getter reads the scaled cull threshold

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** draw distance
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-18 (#30).
- **Where:** `sub_825B5730` (`generated/skate3_recomp.29.cpp`). It has no
  direct callers and is reached only through a registered function pointer.
  It reads the global render context's cull object
  (`[[0x820CFD94]+292]+6064`) and returns
  `clamp(int((threshold - c0) * c1), 0, 10)` through `sub_82E86550`.
- **Problem:** it sees the draw-distance scaled value (0.2 becomes 0.05), so
  any script or menu that reads this level gets a shifted number. If a
  matching setter writes a level back through a path
  `src/skate3_draw_distance.cpp` doesn't hook, the scaled value becomes the
  new base and the scale compounds.
- **Next step:** find who registers or calls `sub_825B5730`, and any setter for
  that level, then watch it during a test.

### KI-44: Live draw-distance changes skip setter-only cull objects

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** draw distance
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-18 (#30).
- **Where:** `src/skate3_draw_distance.cpp`.
- **Problem:** a hot change of `skate3_draw_distance_scale` reaches only the
  `view+8` cull objects, which are rescaled every frame. Objects seen only
  through the setter hook keep the old scale until the next config apply.
  Low impact: no setter calls showed up in a boot to gameplay.
- **Next step:** when the cvar value changes, rescale every load-bearing slot
  from the per-frame hook.

### KI-45: XMA context input offset exceeds its buffer

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** audio (SDK APU)
- **Tracking:** none yet. Seen in a normal boot log while testing KI-18 (#30).
- **Symptom:** the log repeats
  `[apu] XmaContext 31 old: input offset 16416 exceeds buffer size 16384`.
  Whether any sound is affected is unknown.
- **Next step:** find the check in the rexglue SDK's XMA decoder and which
  game sound uses context 31. Compare with upstream rexglue-sdk, then listen
  for a missing or clipped sound at the moment the line is logged.

### KI-46: Long user-data paths silently drop a VFS overlay alias

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** app startup, file system overlay
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-19 (#31).
- **Where:** `src/skate3_app_common.cpp`, `Skate3BaseApp::InstallRecipeOverlay`
  / `CreateOverlayDirectory`.
- **Problem:** with a long user-data path, the overlay folder
  `<cache_root>\vfs_big_directory_aliases\data\state\livingworldentities\pedestrian\plugin`
  passes CreateDirectoryW's 248-character limit and is never created. The
  failure is only counted, never logged. A user with a long AppData or
  portable path would silently lose the pedestrian plugin alias.
- **Evidence:** a test run from a long scratch path logged "overlay with 10
  aliases"; the same build from a short path logged 11.
- **Next step:** log which alias failed. Then use `\\?\` long paths or a
  shorter overlay root.

### KI-47: Other startup filesystem calls can throw

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** app startup
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-19 (#31). Code reading only,
  untested.
- **Where:**
  - `src/skate3_app_common.cpp`: `std::filesystem::exists` at the
    portable.txt check, the config/settings paths, `FirstExistingFontPath`,
    the JP font path, and the profiles/config checks in the defaults setup.
    Also `is_directory(defaults.game_data_root)`, and
    `is_directory(portable_saves)` in the post-launch setup.
  - `src/skate3_user_settings.cpp`: `exists(profiles_path)`.
  - `src/skate3_screenshot.cpp`, `ScreenshotPath`: `absolute(...)`.
- **Problem:** the same failure as KI-19. A permissions error on one of these
  paths becomes an uncaught exception.
- **Fix:** one sweep to the `error_code` overloads.

### KI-48: Guest-output view can go stale after an RHI mailbox eviction

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, SDK native RHI
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-20 (#32).
- **Where:** `EnsureOutputSrv` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp` (added in
  #32), and the SDK's `guest_outputs_` map in `native_rhi_d3d12.cpp` and
  `native_rhi_vulkan.cpp`.
- **Problem:** once the map holds more than 6 entries (after several resizes),
  the RHI deletes old texture wrappers and allocates new ones with no serial.
  A new wrapper at the same address and size, for example after resizing back
  to an earlier size, still matches the pointer-plus-size key, so the view
  keeps pointing at the old texture.
- **Evidence:** code reading only, not reproduced.
- **Next step:** give `nrhi::Texture` a creation serial in the SDK (SDK-fork PR
  plus an "sdk: bump" commit) and key the view on it.

### KI-49: Guest-output view may be rebuilt every frame

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, performance
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-20 (#32).
- **Where:** `EnsureOutputSrv` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** the SDK comments describe a "small guest-output mailbox" in the
  presenter. If it rotates images, `context.guest_output` changes every frame,
  so the view is destroyed and recreated every frame.
- **Next step:** log how many times per second the view is rebuilt. If it's
  every frame, keep one view per mailbox image.

### KI-50: Photo FX depth view isn't checked for null

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, photo FX
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-20 (#32).
- **Where:** `RenderScene` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** the result of `CreateTextureView` for `pfx_srv[7]` is passed to
  `pfx_bind_all(..., g_r.pfx_srv[7])` without a null check. A failed create
  binds null for that frame, and it retries the next frame.
- **Fix:** fall back to `g_r.white.srv`, or skip the depth pack when the view
  is null.

### KI-51: Occlusion grid can miss thin gaps at high render scales

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** native renderer, occlusion culling
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-21 (#33).
- **Where:** `ps_depth_max` in `src/native/shaders/ssao.hlsl`.
- **Problem:** the grid reduce takes only 8x8 point samples per tile. Its
  comment accepts that a gap under 3 px can be missed at 4K because "the
  consumer is telemetry, not culling". That's no longer true: the occlusion
  cull reads this grid, so a missed gap can hide a distant object that is
  visible through railings or fence slats. The 1 m depth margin doesn't help
  with gaps. At `resolution_scale = 3` (the user's setting), tiles reach
  about 24 px and the samples are about 3 px apart.
- **Next step:** sample every texel of the tile's footprint, or reduce through
  a two-level chain, and update the comment. Regenerate the SPIR-V. Test by
  looking through fences and railings at render scale 3x, with the occlusion
  cull on and then off.

### KI-52: Demo-path map-switch inputs may not work

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** test tooling
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while testing KI-21 (#33).
- **Where:** the input sequence in the help text of
  `skate3_demo_path_gameplay_inputs` (`src/skate3_demo_path.cpp`).
- **Problem:** in a signed-out demo boot all 14 inputs were injected, but
  nothing loaded and the item counts stayed the same, so the documented
  map-switch sequence seems to do nothing. Unattended tests that rely on it
  would silently stay in one area.
- **Likely cause (from KI-28, #40):** in the current build, LB, LT and RT don't
  change pause-menu tabs; d-pad left/right does. The help text's map-switch
  example uses `rt` for tabs.
- **Seen again (KI-41, #51):** with the documented string
  `start,a,rt:1500,rt:1500,down,down,a,down,down,down,down,down,a,a`, the skater
  stayed in the plaza, standing off the board, and no map change happened.
- **Next step:** update the example to use d-pad left/right, check that it
  reaches a map change (signed in, if that's needed), and fix the help text.

### KI-53: Render targets used before their first clear (D3D12 debug layer)

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, shadows and startup
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-22 (#34).
- **Where:** `EnsureShadowResources` / `RenderShadowAtlas` in
  `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`, plus unidentified resources at boot.
- **Problem:** the D3D12 debug layer reports
  `RENDER_TARGET_OR_DEPTH_STENCIL_RESOUCE_NOT_INITIALIZED` (#1422) twice after
  every shadow atlas recreation. That fits `shadow_mid` and `shadow_final`:
  the blur pass draws into them, but only `shadow_raw` is ever cleared. It's
  probably harmless, since the blur writes every texel of each tile. The same
  error also appears 4 times at boot and 17 times when gameplay starts, from
  resources not yet identified.
- **Next step:** clear or discard `shadow_mid` and `shadow_final` once after
  creation. Then run with the debug layer and find the boot-time ones (the
  KI-22 agent's `dbwin.ps1` captures debug-layer output without a debugger).

### KI-54: Shadow-dump readback buffers are never freed (debug only)

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, diagnostics
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-22 (#34).
- **Where:** `RenderShadowAtlas` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problems:**
  - After one shadow recording, the four readback buffers stay allocated for
    the rest of the session. At tile 4096 that is about 400 MB each, about
    1.6 GB in all. The only release is the size-mismatch path #34 added.
  - Dump file names use a seconds timestamp plus the frame index, so two
    recordings in the same second overwrite each other.
  - A recording usually yields 3 dumps, not `kShadowDumpFrames` = 4, because
    the recording window is shorter than 4 shadow frames.
- **Next step:** release the buffers once a session's dumps are written, and
  add a counter to the file name.

### KI-55: App callbacks that capture `this` are never cleared on shutdown

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** app lifetime
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-23 (#35).
- **Where:** `OnPostSetup` / `OnShutdown` in `src/skate3_app_common.cpp`.
- **Problem:** six callbacks capture `this` and are never cleared:
  `input_system->SetActiveCallback`, `SetMenuChordCallback`,
  `demo_path::SetUiInputProvider` and the three `options_menu::Set*Callback`.
  The active callback also reads `simple_settings_dialog_` on the input path
  while `OnShutdown` resets it on the UI thread. That's a data race or
  use-after-free on any path where `OnShutdown` runs while the guest is
  still alive. Today that is mainly Close Game on macOS (`QuitFromUIThread`,
  which ends the guest after `OnShutdown`).
- **Fix:** clear these callbacks (null or no-op) at the top of `OnShutdown`.

### KI-56: SDK key binds: duplicate registration and callbacks under the lock

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** SDK input
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-23 (#35).
- **Where:** `RegisterBind` / `UnregisterBind` / `ProcessKeyEvent` in
  rexglue-sdk `src/ui/keybinds.cpp`.
- **Problem:** re-registering a name appends a duplicate entry and registers
  the cvar again, while `UnregisterBind` only nulls the first match. Bind
  callbacks also run under the non-recursive `g_binds_mutex`, so a bind that
  registers or unregisters a bind would deadlock. Neither happens today,
  because `RestartGame` starts a new process instead of re-registering.
- **Next step:** make `RegisterBind` replace by name, and call callbacks
  outside the lock. That needs an SDK-fork PR plus an "sdk: bump" commit.

### KI-57: SDK `fullscreen` change callback is never unregistered

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** SDK app lifetime
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-23 (#35).
- **Where:** rexglue-sdk `src/ui/rex_app.cpp`. `SetupPresentation` registers a
  `fullscreen` change callback that captures `this`, and `OnDestroy` only
  unregisters `show_fps_counter`.
- **Problem:** a `fullscreen` change after the app object is destroyed would
  call into it. Unlikely, since the process exits right after.
- **Fix:** add `UnregisterChangeCallbacks("fullscreen")` to `OnDestroy`.

### KI-58: SDK `ParseXuid` misreads decimal XUIDs

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** SDK user profile
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-24 (#36).
- **Where:** `ParseXuid` in rexglue-sdk `src/system/xam/user_profile.cpp`, used
  by `UserProfile::UserProfile`.
- **Problem:** it's a copy of the game's old parser and still tries hex
  first, so a decimal `--user_profile_xuid=12345` passed by hand becomes XUID
  0x12345. The game itself always passes hex from `FormatXuid`, so normal
  play is unaffected.
- **Fix:** apply #36's rules in the SDK fork (a `0x` prefix or 16 hex digits
  is hex; other all-digit strings are decimal), or have the SDK call one
  shared parser.

### KI-59: A malformed profiles.toml silently wipes all profiles

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** user settings, profiles
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-24 (#36).
- **Where:** `LoadProfiles` in `src/skate3_user_settings.cpp`, and the
  `save_profile` lambda in `src/skate3_app_common.cpp`.
- **Problem:** `LoadProfiles` catches `toml::parse_error`, returns an empty
  store and logs nothing. The next profile save then calls
  `EnsureUsableProfileStore`, which adds a default "Player" profile, and
  overwrites the user's file with it. Any malformed `profiles.toml` (a hand
  edit, invalid UTF-8, see KI-60) destroys every profile on the next save.
- **Next step:** log the parse error, and back up or refuse to overwrite a file
  that didn't parse.

### KI-60: Gamertag truncation can produce invalid UTF-8

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** SDK settings overlay, profiles
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-24 (#36).
- **Where:** `CopyToBuffer` in rexglue-sdk
  `src/ui/overlay/simple_settings_overlay.cpp`.
- **Problem:** the gamertag is copied into `gamertag_buf_[32]` byte by byte,
  which can cut a multi-byte UTF-8 character in half. `SaveProfile` then
  writes invalid UTF-8, toml++ rejects the file, and KI-59 wipes the
  profiles. It needs a gamertag over 31 bytes with a non-ASCII character at
  the cut, so in practice only hand-edited names hit it.
- **Fix:** truncate at a UTF-8 character boundary.

### KI-61: Palette scoring rejects samples at the edges of very wide views

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** native renderer, ultrawide, skinned characters and vehicles
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-25 (#37).
- **Where:** `RefinePaletteBase` (the `score` lambda) and `ScoreRigidAffine`
  in `src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`.
- **Problem:** both accept a sample only if it projects within 1.5x of the
  guest bank's own 16:9 clip volume. The ultrawide view reaches
  |x|/w = 1/scale, which is 1.31 at 21:9 (fine) but 2.0 at 32:9. From about
  2.4:1 up, skinned characters or vehicles near the side edges may fail
  palette validation and render mangled or fall back.
- **Next step:** pass the Hor+ scale into the x band, or widen it to
  `1.5f / hor_scale`, then test at 32:9.

### KI-62: Vehicle retention box may not track the car's real position

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, vehicles
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-25 (#37).
- **Where:** vehicle retention in `BuildFrameScene` (`src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`),
  the `bone_center` / `DynRetained::half` box.
- **Evidence:** in two unattended runs, 7,052 (D3D12) and 16,649 (Vulkan) live,
  non-caster vehicle captures had a box entirely outside even the wide guest
  frustum. Either the game submits cars for other perspective passes (such as
  reflections), or the averaged bone position plus the bind-pose bbox diagonal
  isn't a reliable proxy. If it's the proxy, every retention decision for
  vehicles is less reliable than it looks.
- **Next step:** log which plane rejects these boxes and their `dbg_src`.

### KI-63: Traffic may despawn by 16:9 visibility on ultrawide

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed guess) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** ultrawide, game logic
- **Tracking:** none yet. Raised while fixing KI-25 (#37).
- **Problem:** only the cull block's left and right planes are widened for
  ultrawide. If the game's traffic despawn or "out of view" logic uses its own
  16:9 visibility, cars could despawn while visible in the side bands.
  Retention can't hide that, since it covers only 10 frames.
- **Next step:** only if edge popping is still seen after #37: find the
  traffic despawn visibility check in the recompiled code and see which
  frustum it uses.

### KI-64: Raw guest loads in the capture path and render hooks

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** native renderer, guest memory safety
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-26 (#38).
- **Where:**
  - `src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`: `BuildItemFromMeshCached` reads
    `mesh+0x34` and `mesh+0x30` raw on every frame's cache-hit check, and
    `BuildItemGeometry` reads `ctx` and then `record` raw.
  - `src/skate3_native_render.cpp`: `REX_LOAD_U32(sort_vec)`,
    `REX_LOAD_U32(entry + 4)`, `self + 3240` and `REX_LOAD_U8(self + 3397/3396)`
    in the hooks.
- **Problem:** if streaming unmaps a mesh between being recorded and the frame
  build, the guest render thread faults and the game crashes.
  `GuestReadRecoveryScope` is a no-op on Windows, so nothing catches it. The
  risk is low, because these pointers come from what the game is drawing
  right now.
- **Next step:** switch them to `GuestTryLoadU32`. That's a few guarded calls
  per item per frame, so measure the cost with `perf_items`.

### KI-65: Prewarm retries lose the visible-miss priority

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** native renderer, streaming
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-26 (#38).
- **Where:** the retry branch of `ProcessPrewarmEntry` in
  `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** the retry is pushed as
  `g_prewarm_retry.push_back({e.mesh, uint16_t(e.retries - 1)})`, which drops
  `e.miss`. `PrewarmCommit` then puts it back into the LIFO
  `g_prewarm_queue`, not `g_miss_queue`. So a mesh the player can see, whose
  first build failed, waits behind the speculative prewarm backlog and the
  per-frame commit cap. That looks like longer pop-in or white surfaces while
  streaming.
- **Fix:** copy `e`, decrement its retries, and send miss retries back to
  `g_miss_queue`.

### KI-66: Prewarm workers re-queue texture and cube misses as meshes at startup

- **Status:** open (unconfirmed) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, streaming
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-26 (#38).
- **Where:** `PrewarmWorkerLoop` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** when `base` or `g_r.device` is still null at startup, the
  worker re-queues the whole entry with `g_prewarm_retry.push_back(e)`.
  `PrewarmCommit` moves retries into `g_prewarm_queue` without keeping track
  of what kind of entry each was, so a texture-only or cube entry is later
  decoded as a mesh and that miss is lost. Startup only, low impact.
- **Next step:** confirm by reading the code, then send misses back to
  `g_miss_queue` with their kind kept.

### KI-67: Mesh decodes that always fail are retried every frame

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, streaming
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-27 (#39).
- **Where:** `ProcessPrewarmEntry` → `PrewarmCommit` → the draw path in
  `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** a failed mesh decode is committed with `mesh_valid=false` and
  its in-flight key is released. The next draw-path miss calls
  `EnqueueMeshMiss` again, with no negative cache or backoff (textures have
  `RetryBackoff`, meshes don't). So a mesh that can never decode costs a
  pointless worker decode every frame it's visible. #39's new rejections are
  cheap and run before any copy, but other failures still do the full work.
- **Fix:** a per-mesh fail count with backoff, like `GuestTexture::fail_count`.

### KI-68: Prewarm log counts are misleading

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, diagnostics
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-27 (#39).
- **Where:** `PrewarmCommit` and the settle warm loop (the `need_mesh` branch
  near the `REVALIDATE` debug log) in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problems:**
  - `g_prewarm_done` counts every result, including `mesh_valid=false` and
    texture-only results, so "N meshes decoded" isn't the number of
    successful decodes. Baseline comparisons between agent runs used it.
  - The settle loop's comment says failures are "logged + counted" through the
    draw path, but the failure itself isn't counted there; only the later
    draw-path retry is (`g_rr_decode_fail`).
- **Fix:** count successes separately (or rename the log field), and fix the
  comment.

### KI-69: Staged restart-required choices can linger in the Options menu

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** Options menu
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-28 (#40).
- **Where:** `Row::pending` in `src/skate3_options_menu.cpp`, cleared only by
  the restart prompt's buttons (`ApplyPendingAndRestart` / `DiscardPending`).
- **Problem:** leaving a page without Back leaves the staged choices in place.
  That happens when the pause menu is closed from a page, on a popup flush, or
  when `ShowRestartPrompt` fails because the manager pointer is null and falls
  through to the game's Back. The next visit shows them again, and Back
  prompts again.
- **Next step:** decide whether leaving the Options state should discard them;
  that means hooking the Options state's exit, which isn't identified yet. A
  small debug cvar that triggers a popup flush (`sub_825D8AF0` →
  `sub_82D0A738`) would let the flush path be tested unattended.

### KI-70: Restart prompt's Discard doesn't check it's acting on the Options state

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** Options menu
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-28 (#40). Code reading only.
- **Where:** the Discard branch of the `sub_8260EA48` hook in
  `src/skate3_options_menu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** it uses `OptionsState()` (`owner+180`) without checking that the
  object is a FrontEndState_Options. If the Options state is gone when Discard
  fires, `PageOf` reads +68 of whatever object is there and could call
  `sub_8260D078` on it. Unlikely, because the popup is modal over Options.
- **Fix:** check the state's vtable against 0x823034B0 before acting.

### KI-71: Restart prompt shows no title

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** Options menu, cosmetic
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-28 (#40).
- **Where:** `ShowRestartPrompt` in `src/skate3_options_menu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** it writes the "Restart Required" title ID, but the in-game
  popup shows only the message and the buttons.
- **Next step:** check whether the popup layout uses the +0 field at all, or
  needs another flag to show a title.

### KI-72: The Defender trojan trigger still ships on main

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** medium (blocks the next release)
- **Area:** Windows release, exe icon
- **Tracking:** rubensteezy/skate3recomp#18 (open). Raised again while fixing
  KI-29 (#41).
- **Where:** `EnsureExeIconResource` and `SpawnPreIconDeleter` in
  `src/skate3_win_icon.cpp`.
- **Problem:** #18 removes the self-patching exe icon that makes Defender flag
  the Windows zip as a trojan, but it isn't merged. So `main` still patches
  every fresh `skate3.exe` on first run, parks the old exe in `%TEMP%`, and
  starts a hidden `powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden` deleter. Any release cut
  from `main` keeps the trigger.
- **Also:**
  - #18 removes the `%TEMP%\skate3-pre-icon-*.old` sweep and has no
    `.icon-new` cleanup. Once it merges, the hidden 100 MB parked exes and
    crash leftovers already on v2.1.0 users' machines are never removed.
  - #41 (KI-29) hardens the same self-patch code, so it conflicts with #18.
- **Next step:** decide on #18 and merge it before the next release. Keep a
  one-time, delete-only sweep of the old leftovers in it: either rebase #41
  down to just its `CleanupStaleIconTemp`, or close #41.

### KI-73: Exe path lookup truncates on long install paths

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** Windows, exe icon
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-29 (#41).
- **Where:** `EnsureExeIconResource` and the icon thread in
  `src/skate3_win_icon.cpp`.
- **Problem:** they call `GetModuleFileNameW` with a `MAX_PATH` buffer. For an
  install path over 260 characters it truncates but still returns non-zero,
  so the code works on a wrong path. Low risk, since the moves then just
  fail. Moot if #18 removes this code.
- **Fix:** use a growing buffer and check for `ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER`.

### KI-74: SDK cvar overrides drop user changes made while held

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, settings
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-30 (#42).
- **Where:** `SdkCvarOverride` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** while an override holds a cvar, `Release` restores `saved_`, so
  any write another thread makes in the meantime is dropped. That includes
  the options menu, the settings overlay and the console. There's also a
  microsecond window where the F12 dialog sees "not held", the user clicks,
  and the render thread acquires before the write lands. #42 adds a warning,
  "SDK cvar override on ... was overwritten while held", that shows when this
  happens.
- **Next step:** if that warning ever appears, add a "user set while held" path
  that updates `saved_`.

### KI-75: Scene ring dumps taken in the same second overwrite each other

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, diagnostics
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-32 (#44).
- **Where:** `MaybeDumpSceneRing` in `src/skate3_native_scene_state.h`.
  `SnapshotStem` in `src/native/skate3_native_diagnostics.cpp` uses the same
  seconds-only naming.
- **Problem:** the dump file is `logs/scene_ring_<time in seconds>.csv`, so an
  F7 dump and an RB+A dump in the same second overwrite each other. That's the
  same bug #44 fixes for screenshots. A snapshot takes several frames, so a
  clash there is unlikely.
- **Also:** the comment in `skate3_screenshot.h` says A/B captures "share one
  timestamp". They actually share a tag with its own HH:MM:SS, and the file
  stamps differ.
- **Fix:** reuse #44's millisecond stamp, and reword the comment.

### KI-76: Scene ring may use about 150 MB while on (debug only)

- **Status:** open (estimate, not measured) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, diagnostics
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-32 (#44).
- **Where:** `kSceneRingFrames` (2400) and `SceneRingItem` (about 80 bytes).
- **Problem:** at about 800 items a frame, 2400 frames is roughly 150 MB of RAM
  while `skate3_native_render_scene_ring` is on, and a dump would be a few
  hundred MB of CSV. It's off by default and debug-only.
- **Next step:** measure it, and put the real size in the cvar help text.

### KI-77: Photo grab assumes 4-byte output pixels

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, photo grab
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-32 (#44).
- **Where:** `RendererState::kGrabRowPitch = kBlurWidth * 4`; the grab reads
  `blur_tex[0]`, which uses the output format.
- **Problem:** that's correct for today's fixed R10G10B10A2 output. If the output
  format ever changed (the case #44 now guards for the blur targets), the
  pitch and the CPU tiling would be wrong. The output format is a compile-time
  constant in the SDK (`kGuestOutputFormat`), so nothing at runtime changes it
  today.
- **Fix:** add a static check or a comment next to #44's format key.

### KI-78: SDK settings.toml handling has the same reset and flush gaps as KI-59

- **Status:** open (code reading only) · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** SDK settings
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-59 (#45).
- **Where:** `SaveConfigValues` / `WriteConfigFile` in rexglue-sdk
  `src/core/cvar.cpp`, and `EnsureSimpleSettingsConfig` in
  `src/ui/overlay/simple_settings_overlay.cpp`.
- **Problem:** `toml::parse_file` also throws `parse_error` when it can't open
  the file. So a locked or unreadable `settings.toml` is treated as malformed
  and rewritten with only the given cvars, which drops every other key. A
  malformed file is rewritten with no backup. `WriteConfigFile` uses
  temp-and-rename but never flushes the temp file to disk.
- **Next step:** in the SDK fork, read the bytes separately before parsing,
  back up a malformed file the way #45 does, and flush before the rename.
  That needs an SDK-fork PR plus an "sdk: bump" commit.

### KI-79: With profiles.toml unreadable, the career save goes to a temporary profile

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** profiles, saves
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-59 (#45).
- **Where:** `LoadProfiles` and `OnFinalizePaths` in `src/skate3_user_settings.cpp`
  and `src/skate3_app_common.cpp`.
- **Problem:** after #45, when the file can't be read (it's locked, or the
  backup couldn't be verified), the store is `save_blocked`. The game then
  runs signed in as a temporary default "Player", and the career save goes to
  that profile's XUID folder. In the locked test, a `B13E07DFF9AB6772` save
  folder was created; the real file and saves were untouched.
- **Also:** the startup default-profile write only happens when
  `<exe dir>\skate3.toml` exists and `game_data_root` is set, so a dev build
  run with neither never writes a default `profiles.toml`. That's probably
  intended, but it isn't documented.
- **Next step:** when `save_blocked` is set, show a dialog or boot signed out.
  Confirm and document the default-profile write condition.

### KI-80: Profiles with a missing id, gamertag or XUID are lost on the next save

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** profiles
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-59 (#45).
- **Where:** `LoadProfiles` in `src/skate3_user_settings.cpp`.
- **Problem:** such entries are dropped at load (#45 adds a warning), so the
  next save removes them from the file. With #36's stricter
  `ParseXuidString`, more hand-edited XUID strings parse to 0 and are
  dropped.
- **Next step:** keep unusable entries unchanged on save, or back the file up
  the first time anything is dropped.

### KI-81: Non-ASCII paths are mis-decoded, and `path.string()` may throw on them

- **Status:** open (mis-decoding confirmed; throwing unverified) ·
  **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** SDK app startup, settings, app logging
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-59 (#45); confirmed while
  fixing KI-46 (#46).
- **Problems:**
  - **Mis-decoding (confirmed):** the SDK's path setup in `src/ui/rex_app.cpp`
    assigns a UTF-8 `std::string` straight to `std::filesystem::path`
    (`user_dir = user_data_cvar;`). Windows reads that as the ANSI code page.
    The same pattern is used for `game_data_root`, `cache_root`,
    `update_data_root` and the settings.toml path values. With
    `--user_data_root=...\na_Jiří_日本` the game booted, but all user data
    (cache, dlc, settings.toml) went into a mojibake folder
    `na_JiÅ™Ã­_æ—¥æœ¬`, and the intended folder stayed empty. The log still
    shows the right name.
  - **Throwing (unverified):** `std::filesystem::path::string()` converts to the
    ANSI code page and can throw for characters outside it. The SDK passes it
    to `toml::parse_file` in `ReXApp::SetupEnvironment`,
    `ConfigFileContainsAnyKey` and `SaveConfigValues`. The game's own `src/`
    has 52 more `.string()` calls across 9 files, many in log lines on user
    paths: the DLC scan, "Skate 3 saves: using portable folder", and
    `content_root.string()` in `InstallRecipeOverlay`. These are reachable
    through the default AppData path (a non-ASCII Windows username) or a
    portable install folder, so they could crash startup for those users.
- **Next step:** in the SDK, build these paths with `rex::to_path(utf8)` and
  replace `.string()` with UTF-8 conversion (SDK-fork PR plus an "sdk: bump"
  commit). In the game, sweep `src/` to `rex::path_to_utf8`. Then test with a
  portable install in a non-ASCII folder.

### KI-82: Persistent shader storage is disabled on long user-data paths

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** SDK D3D12 pipeline cache
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-46 (#46).
- **Where:** `InitializeShaderStorage` in rexglue-sdk
  `src/graphics/d3d12/pipeline_cache.cpp`.
- **Problem:** with a 218-character user-data root, it logged "Failed to open
  the Direct3D 12 pipeline description storage file for writing, persistent
  shader storage will be disabled". The storage file path was about
  290 characters. The game runs, but shaders recompile on every boot. Vulkan
  wasn't checked.
- **Next step:** use `\\?\` paths for the cache root in the SDK, the way #46
  does for the overlay. Adding `longPathAware` to `src/skate3_app.manifest`
  only helps where the LongPathsEnabled policy is set.

### KI-83: Saves may fail on long user-data paths

- **Status:** open (code reading only) · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** SDK content, saves
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-46 (#46).
- **Where:** `ContentManager::ResolvePackagePath` builds
  `<root>\<xuid 16>\<title 8>\<type 8>\<name>\...` with plain paths, and
  `HostPathEntry::CreateEntryInternal` and the file opens use no `\\?\`
  prefix.
- **Problem:** a long AppData or portable path would hit MAX_PATH at a slightly
  shorter root than the overlay did, so career saves could fail to write.
- **Next step:** give content roots the same `\\?\` treatment in the SDK, then
  run a save test on a long root.

### KI-84: MAX_PATH buffers truncate long exe and file-dialog paths

- **Status:** open (code reading only) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** app, installers
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-46 (#46). See also KI-73.
- **Where:**
  - `Skate3BaseApp::RestartGame` (`src/skate3_app_common.cpp`):
    `GetModuleFileNameW` with a MAX_PATH buffer. On truncation it doesn't
    return 0, so `CreateProcessW` gets a cut path, the restart fails, and the
    log is misleading.
  - `PickIsoFile` (`src/skate3_iso_installer.cpp`) and `PickTitleUpdateFile`
    (`src/skate3_title_update_installer.cpp`): MAX_PATH file-dialog buffers,
    so picking a file deeper than 260 characters fails.
- **Fix:** use the SDK's `rex::filesystem::GetExecutablePath()`, which already
  handles long paths, and bigger dialog buffers.

### KI-85: Dropping a speculative prewarm entry clears a live miss's in-flight key

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, streaming
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-65 (#47).
- **Where:** the `if (dropped)` branch of `ProcessPrewarmEntry` in
  `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`.
- **Problem:** it calls `g_miss_inflight_mesh.erase(e.mesh)` without checking
  `e.miss`. When a speculative entry for mesh X is dropped while a miss for X
  is still in flight, the miss's key is cleared, and the draw path can queue
  a second decode of X. That wastes worker time but has no visual effect.
- **Fix:** erase only when `e.miss` is set.

### KI-86: The prewarm miss queue pops from the front of a vector

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, streaming performance
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-65 (#47).
- **Where:** `PrewarmWorkerLoop` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`, and
  `skate3_native_scene_state.h`.
- **Problem:** `g_miss_queue.erase(g_miss_queue.begin())` costs time in
  proportion to the queue length (capped at 65536) while `g_prewarm_mutex` is
  held, so a large streaming burst could stall the workers. `g_dyn_jobs` has
  the same pattern.
- **Also:** the null base/device re-queue in `PrewarmWorkerLoop` is close to
  dead code (the workers start only once `g_r.device` is set, and nothing
  resets it). It never decrements retries, so if it ever ran for long it
  would spin entries every 100 ms per worker without end.
- **Next step:** switch both queues to `std::deque` if a profile shows lock
  contention. Turn the null re-queue into a plain wait.

### KI-87: Raw guest loads in the `CaptureDynamicState` pre-check

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** native renderer, guest memory safety
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-64 (#48). The biggest remaining
  risk of the KI-64 kind.
- **Where:** the world-path pre-check of `CaptureDynamicState` in
  `src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`, called about 800 times a frame from
  `OnSceneDrawList`. It reads `ctx → record → mesh → vdesc` and the vertex
  elements raw (`REX_LOAD_U32(ctx)`, `REX_LOAD_U32(record)`,
  `REX_LOAD_U16(vdesc + 8)` and others). Further down, `ctx + kCtxEffectList`
  and `effect_list + kEffectListPassCount` are raw too.
- **Problem:** a stale pointer there crashes the guest render thread, the same
  way as KI-64.
- **Fix:** reuse one ctx-head guarded copy, as #48's `BuildItemGeometry` does,
  and measure the cost the same way #48 did.

### KI-88: Remaining raw guest loads elsewhere in capture (low risk)

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, guest memory safety
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-64 (#48).
- **Where** (`src/skate3_native_scene.cpp` unless noted):
  - `CaptureClothDraw`: `vb_obj + 0x18/0x20`.
  - The neighbour read in `ComputeItemFingerprint`:
    `mix(REX_LOAD_U64(addr + off))`.
  - `OnSetViewport` and `OnSetScissor`.
  - The `REX_LOAD_U8(obj + 0x54 + k)` shader-name loops.
  - The `device + 0x480` fetch-constant reads.
- **Problem:** the same fault risk as KI-64, but most of these read device or
  current-draw state, so the risk is low.
- **Also:**
  - `GuestReadableApprox` only checks `addr >= 0x10000` (its `base` argument
    is unused), but its name suggests a real readability check.
  - `OnSceneDrawList` and `FilterSceneDrawList` (`src/skate3_native_render.cpp`)
    both copy the same sort-list segment per dispatch. The cost is
    negligible.
- **Next step:** no code change until a crash points at one of these. Rename or
  document `GuestReadableApprox`. Optionally, pass the captured segment to
  the filter.

### KI-89: Raw writes through just-read pointers in the auto-exposure hook

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, guest memory safety
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-64 (#48).
- **Where:** `sub_827F0D00` in `src/skate3_native_render.cpp`:
  `REX_STORE_U32(inst_a + 48 / inst_b + 56)`.
- **Problem:** these write through pointers read a moment earlier. A stale
  instance pointer would be a write fault, or would corrupt guest memory if
  the page has been reused.
- **Next step:** low priority. Check `inst_a` / `inst_b` against a guarded read
  of their vtable or type before the stores.

### KI-90: The bone-ring comment blames the wrong cause for hair shimmer

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, characters
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while checking KI-38 (#49).
- **Where:** the `RendererState::kBoneRegions` comment in
  `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu_internal.h`.
- **Problem:** it blames hair shimmer and collapsed garments on the Vulkan GPU
  running more than 3 frames behind, which is why the ring is 8 deep. #49
  measured that frames never go past 3 on either backend. Submissions do:
  Vulkan reached 6 in flight while loading, because there are several per
  frame. A ring keyed by frame number with 4 or more regions is never reused
  while the GPU still reads it, so that corruption had another cause.
- **Also:** #28's "K/N regions in flight" and "all N regions in flight" upload
  ring lines can't fire in normal operation for the same reason. Consider
  lowering their threshold to "more than 3".
- **Next step:** if the shimmer comes back, look for a `RenderScene` that runs
  more than once per `g_frames_rendered` value, or at the ROPA generation
  ring. Then fix the comment.

### KI-91: Frame rate is uncapped by default

- **Status:** open (decision) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** settings defaults
- **Tracking:** none yet. Noticed while checking KI-38 (#49).
- **Problem:** the SDK `vsync` cvar defaults to false, and at default settings
  both backends ran at about 4.4 ms per frame (about 225 fps). That may cost
  power and heat for no benefit, especially on laptops.
- **Next step:** decide whether release defaults should turn on vsync or a
  frame cap. Settings > Display already has Framerate Cap and V-Sync rows.

### KI-92: `ScoreRigidAffine` has no in-front-of-camera check

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, player garments
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-61 (#50).
- **Where:** `ScoreRigidAffine` in `src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`.
- **Problem:** its strict count accepts a sample when `|x|` and `|y|` are within
  1.5·|w|, without requiring `clip[3] > 0`. So a matrix that places the
  garment behind the camera can still score well. `RefinePaletteBase` has
  that check, and its comment explains it exists for exactly this case. The
  structural tail-row check on the matrix block reduces the risk.
- **Fix:** add `clip[3] > 0.0f` to the strict count, then re-test the player's
  tee (Ropa, sim active) up close.

### KI-93: Character shadows may be cut off at the edges on 32:9 ultrawide

- **Status:** open (unverified) · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** ultrawide, shadows
- **Tracking:** none yet. Raised while fixing KI-61 (#50).
- **Problem:** at 32:9, the game's sun-shadow bank puts characters in the side
  bands at |x|/w up to about 2.0; at 16:9 that never passes 1.5. So the
  game's shadow projection seems to be fitted to the 16:9 view only, and
  shadows of characters or cars near the far edges may be missing or cut
  off.
- **Next step:** at 32:9, compare character and car shadows at the far edges
  with the centre. If they're missing, check which projection the native
  shadow atlas uses, and whether it can be widened the way the cull frustum
  is.

### KI-94: Demo-path inputs can't move the camera

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** test tooling
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while testing KI-61 (#50).
- **Where:** `skate3_demo_path_gameplay_inputs` in `src/skate3_demo_path.cpp`.
- **Problem:** it only takes button tokens, no sticks, so unattended runs
  can't pan the camera or put characters at the screen edges on purpose.
  That limited the testing of KI-25 (#37) and KI-61 (#50).
- **Fix:** add stick tokens, for example `rs_left:ms` and `ls_up:ms`.

### KI-95: Shadow-atlas casters don't stamp their mesh entries

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low–medium
- **Area:** native renderer, shadows, mesh cache
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-41 (#51). The same kind of bug
  as KI-41, for meshes.
- **Where:** the caster loop of `RenderShadowAtlas` in
  `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`. It checks `g_r.meshes.contains(item.mesh)`
  and later does `g_r.meshes.find(...)`, but never sets the mesh's
  `last_used_frame`. `RenderStaticSunMap` does
  (`mit->second.last_used_frame = frame_number`).
- **Problem:** under mesh-store pressure
  (`skate3_native_render_scene_mesh_store_mb`), the mesh of a caster the main
  pass doesn't draw can be evicted. The caster then silently drops out of the
  shadow, because the pass `continue`s on a missing mesh.
- **Evidence:** a temporary counter found 5,995 to 25,377 caster-frames per
  150 s run whose mesh hadn't been stamped for more than 5 s. No mesh was
  actually skipped, because the 1024 MB mesh budget was never under pressure.
- **Fix:** stamp `mit->second.last_used_frame` in the atlas loop, then test with
  a small mesh budget.

### KI-96: The texture store budget can't go below 256 MB for testing

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** test tooling
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while fixing KI-41 (#51).
- **Where:** the `.range(256, 16384)` on `skate3_native_render_scene_tex_store_mb`
  in `src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`, and `std::max(256, …)` in `EvictTexStore`.
- **Problem:** the floor is enforced twice. A light area's working set is
  about 225 MB, so at 256 MB the LRU never starts, and reproducing store
  pressure there needs a code change.
- **Next step:** if testing at low budgets matters, lower the floor for dev
  builds or add a debug cvar.

### KI-97: No way to quit from the game's own menus in fullscreen

- **Status:** open (feature request)
- **Area:** Options menu, app exit
- **Tracking:** agent working on it (user request, 2026-10-28).
- **Symptom:** in fullscreen there's no window X. A controller player can quit
  only through the Esc overlay's Close Game. The game's own Options menu has
  no quit option.
- **Next step:** add a "Quit Game" row after the PC settings rows on the root
  Options screen, with a confirmation popup (the popup-id mechanism from #40).
  Exit through the same clean path as Close Game.
- **Tracking update:** rubensteezy/skate3recomp#52, awaiting in-game test.

### KI-98: B doesn't dismiss the Options menu's custom popups

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** Options menu
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while building KI-97 (#52).
- **Where:** the `sub_8260EA48` hook in `src/skate3_options_menu.cpp`, and the
  popup manager's input path near `sub_825EF698`.
- **Problem:** pressing B while the quit prompt is up does nothing, and no
  callback fires. The restart prompt (#40) probably behaves the same, and the
  KI-28 tests found it is A-only. #52 puts Cancel first so the highlighted
  button is the safe one.
- **Next step:** find how the popup manager handles B, if B-to-cancel is wanted.

### KI-99: The pause menu's Options tab has no quit item

- **Status:** open (feature idea) · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** pause menu
- **Tracking:** none yet. Raised while building KI-97 (#52).
- **Where:** the pause menu (the "crossbar"). Its Options tab (gear) lists Game
  Settings, Music Player, Extras and Sign in to EA Nation. The item table is
  around `0x830275A0`, in 20-byte entries {name, title ID, icon, int, helper ID}.
  It already has an `ExitDemo` entry at `0x830278C8` (`ID_DEMO_EXIT` "Exit
  Demo", icon "quit"), used only by the trial build.
- **Idea:** a Quit item after Sign in to EA Nation, reusing #52's prompt and
  `CloseGame()`, would be one step quicker than Options > Game Settings >
  Quit Game.

### KI-100: The root Options rows are cut off in a small window

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** Options menu, layout
- **Tracking:** none yet. Found while building KI-97 (#52).
- **Problem:** in a 1294x758 window, the Quit Game row (the seventh added row) is
  half off the bottom of the screen. Fullscreen is probably fine.
- **Next step:** check whether the game's list scrolls. If not, consider
  grouping the PC rows under one entry.

### KI-101: Distant pop-in during free roam

- **Status:** open · **Severity:** low
- **Area:** native renderer, streaming / LOD
- **Tracking:** none yet. Seen by the user while testing KI-21 (#33) on
  2026-10-28.
- **Symptom:** objects pop in at a distance while skating, noticed with
  Ambient Occlusion off (D3D12, 4K, MSAA 8x).
- **Ruled out:** the occlusion cull. The pop-in stayed with
  `--skate3_native_render_scene_occlusion_cull=false`.
- **Not yet checked:** whether it also shows with AO on, on the emulated
  renderer (F5), or with a different draw distance. It may be the game's own
  streaming/LOD distance rather than a native-renderer bug.
- **Next step:** compare the same route on F5 and at a higher
  `skate3_draw_distance_scale` (see KI-18, #30).

## Resolved

### KI-1: Texture pop-in and flicker while streaming

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#3 (README entry removed in #5)
- **Symptom:** streamed surfaces briefly showed solid colours or other texture
  layers.
- **Fix:** in-place texture payload changes are confirmed before the texture
  is decoded again. Confirmed in-game on 2026-10-12.

### KI-2: Skater rendering in Edit Skater

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#4, #6 and #8
- **Symptoms:**
  - After skin-tone edits, the native skater showed red patterned arms,
    see-through eyes and the wrong hair for a few seconds (#4).
  - The skater's hair in Edit Skater looked darker than on the emulated
    renderer (#6 and #8).
- **Fix:**
  - #4 keys the texture hold and sticky sites by piece signature, so rebuilt
    pieces no longer pick up each other's textures.
  - #6 ports the `cac_hair` Kajiya-Kay strand highlight.
  - #8 shades `cac_hair` with the world sun shadow.

### KI-4: Bruises and dirt don't show on the player character

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#20. Bruises and dirt confirmed
  in-game on 2026-10-12. Tattoos were split out as KI-6.
- **Symptom:** bruising and dirt didn't appear on the skater on the native
  renderer. The emulated renderer showed them.
- **Cause:** the CAC pixel shaders (`cacstamp_skin`, `cac_face`,
  `cacstamp_cloth`, `cac_cloth`, `cacstamp_shift`) blend up to two extra layers
  over the tinted diffuse before lighting:
  - `i_decal` is the tattoo stamp, placed with the vertex shader's
    `i_customGraphic` affine of texcoord 1.
  - `i_decal2` is bruise/dirt at uv0, scaled by `i_params.z` on skin or `.y`
    on cloth.

  The native fam-2 branch only drew the diffuse.
- **Fix:** `CaptureCacDecals` captures the layers' fetch words, the affine and
  the amounts into `char_rows`. The renderer binds them at t8/t9, and
  `scene_char.hlsli` composites them. Cvar:
  `skate3_native_render_scene_char_decals`.

### KI-5: Enhanced shadows show artifacts

- **Status:** won't fix (shelved) in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#21. The cause
  was never found. The options were removed instead.
- **Symptom:** with Enhanced Shadows (the native static sun-shadow map) and
  PCSS on, shadows looked blocky or the wrong shape, not better than stock.
  Repro: D3D12, render scale 3x, MSAA 4x/8x.
- **What #21 did:** removed the options from Settings > Video, Options >
  Graphics and F12 MAX QUALITY, and turned them off by default. The code is
  kept behind `--skate3_native_render_scene_experimental_static_shadows=true`
  and `--skate3_native_render_scene_experimental_pcss=true`.
- **Ruled out:** the static caster cache holding `proxyworld.default`
  stand-in meshes. Dropping them made no visible difference.
- **Main suspect if revisited:** the map casts along the material sun (c6),
  which is about 43 degrees off the game's own stylized shadow axis and may
  disagree with the baked lightmaps.

### KI-7: Dev builds hang on the splash screen with the native renderer on at boot

- **Status:** could not reproduce on `main` (c152af0). No code change. Reopen
  if it happens again, and save the log right away, because only the last 5
  logs are kept.
- **Report:** one dev run on 2026-10-12 (D3D12, KI-5's experimental build,
  33cd9b7 plus an uncommitted shadow change). After language select the intro
  video never started. Frames kept running but slowed, and the window was
  closed after a minute. That log has since rotated away.
- **Misread evidence:** the main-checkout logs that seemed to show the hang
  (`skate3_014`..`018`, c8ba8ac) were shader-disassembly runs. They are killed
  on purpose about 2 s after launch, which is why they stop with no mem lines
  and no "Title terminated" line. `skate3_019`, from the same build with the
  scene on from boot, booted normally. No Vulkan hang was ever seen.
- **Checked:** 20 automated boots of `main` with the native renderer on from
  boot, on D3D12 and Vulkan. That includes 8 with `--skate3_demo_path=true`,
  which injects a pad A at language select. All of them reached the intro
  video or gameplay. The user then booted it with a controller on both
  backends and reached the menus. Notes: KI-7-splash-hang.md in the session
  notes folder.

### KI-8: ISO installer path traversal and partial installs

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#17, tested in-game · was BT-01
- **Problem:** `IsUnsafeIsoPath` only split on `/`, so `\`, drive letters and
  NTFS alternate data streams could escape the install folder on Windows.
  `IsGameInstalled` only checked for `default.xex`, so an interrupted
  extraction counted as installed.
- **Fix:** paths are checked on both separators and rejected for drive
  letters, `:`, control bytes and dot-only components, before anything is
  written. A `.skate3_install_incomplete` marker sits in the game root for
  the whole extraction (`src/skate3_iso_installer.cpp`).

### KI-9: Freecam kept the guest camera after F5 + freecam off

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#17, tested in-game · was BT-02
- **Problem:** `g_freecam_guest_active` was only cleared in `UpdateFreecam`,
  which `BuildFrameScene` skips on its early returns (scene off, no perspective
  view), so the guest camera rewrite and draw-distance recentring stayed on.
- **Fix:** `ReleaseFreecamIfOff` runs at the top of every `BuildFrameScene`.

### KI-10: Freecam needed smooth_camera to take over the guest camera

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#17, tested in-game · was BT-03
- **Problem:** `g_sampler_viewcam` was only stored inside the smooth_camera
  block, so with smoothing off the SetViewMatrix override never matched and
  the game culled around the real camera.
- **Fix:** it is stored every frame; only starting the sampler thread still
  depends on smoothing.

### KI-11: SDK cvar overrides stuck after F5; overlapping save/restore

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#17, tested in-game · was BT-04
- **Problem:** the menu yield, photo-grab window and photo-display yield only
  restored their SDK cvar overrides from RenderScene's normal path, which is
  skipped when the scene is off. Overlapping windows on the same cvar saved
  each other's forced values as the user's.
- **Fix:** one owner-tracked `SdkCvarOverride` per cvar
  (`src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`); `RestoreAllYieldOverrides()` runs on
  RenderScene's scene-off return.
- **Not tested:** re-taking the overrides after F5 back to native.

### KI-12: MAX QUALITY values written to settings.toml

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#17, tested in-game · was BT-05
- **Problem:** any settings save while F12 MAX QUALITY was on wrote its maxed
  values (MSAA, shadows, draw distance and so on) into `settings.toml`.
- **Fix:** saves run inside `WithMaxQualitySuspended`, and the SDK settings
  overlay suspends the mode while it is open.

### KI-13: Shader classifier caches keyed by recycled guest addresses

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#19, tested in-game · was BT-06
- **Problem:** seven classifiers cached their shader debug-path verdict by
  object address forever, but the game recycles shader objects while
  streaming. The env-receiver cache could let an unrelated shader win the
  receiver-row capture, the same failure as the flowingwater dark-world bug.
- **Fix:** `ShaderVerdictMemo` (`src/skate3_native_scene.cpp`) trusts a
  verdict only within the guest frame that computed it.
- **Remaining gap:** a shader recycled within a single frame keeps the old
  verdict until the next frame.

### KI-14: Skinned palette capture read past the VS constant bank

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#19, tested in-game · was BT-07
- **Problem:** `CaptureSkinnedState` copied 84 bones from palette bases up to
  c8, reading up to 4 registers past c255.
- **Fix:** only whole bones inside c0..c255 are read; the rest are zero.

### KI-15: Publish-gap tracker swapped a clone's capture for its twin's

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#19, tested in-game · was BT-08
- **Problem:** the `BuildFrameScene` publish-gap tracker was keyed by mesh, so
  a cloned caster-bank instance was replaced by its twin's same-frame capture
  and drawn at the twin's pose.
- **Fix:** the tracker handles single-instance meshes only.
- **Trade-off:** cloned characters no longer get the caster-bank swap or the
  2-frame gap fill. A `(mesh, ctx)` key could restore both once `ctx` is
  confirmed stable across frames.

### KI-31: C++ tests not built, no CI

- **Status:** fix in review in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#43 · **Severity:**
  low · was BT-24
- **Tracking:** #43. CI: all five `tests` jobs pass on the PR (Python 24/24;
  C++ 3/3 on Windows MSVC 19.51 and clang 22.1, Ubuntu clang 18.1 and
  GCC 13.3).
- **Problem:** `tests/*.cpp` (character fade, Hall of Meat, screen FX) weren't
  wired into CMake, and they used `assert`, which does nothing in release
  builds. This repository had no CI, so neither these nor the Python tests
  (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`) ran automatically.
- **Fix:**
  - `tests/CMakeLists.txt` builds `character_fade_test`, `hall_of_meat_test`
    and `screen_fx_test` and registers them with CTest (the `skate3_tests`
    target builds all three). All three test header-only logic in
    `src/native/` that includes only the standard library, so none was left
    out and no stubs were needed.
  - `-DSKATE3_TESTS_ONLY=ON` configures only the tests, with no SDK checkout,
    game data, title update or codegen; `-DSKATE3_BUILD_TESTS=ON` adds them to
    a normal configure. Commands are in CONTRIBUTING.md under Testing.
  - `assert` is replaced by `CHECK` (`tests/test_check.h`), which runs in
    every build type, reports each failed expression, and makes the test
    exit nonzero.
  - `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`:
    the Python tests on Ubuntu, and the C++ tests with MSVC and clang on
    Windows and clang and GCC on Ubuntu. It checks out no submodules.
- **Checked locally:** Python tests (24) pass; all three C++ tests pass with
  MSVC 19.51 (Release and Debug) and VS clang 22.1.3 (Release, Ninja), using
  the workflow's own commands. A deliberately failing `CHECK` built with
  `-DNDEBUG` exits 1.
- **Candidates to add later:** KI-24's standalone round trip for
  `src/skate3_user_settings.cpp` and KI-27's DecodeMesh validator test. Their
  fixes (#36, #39) aren't on `main` yet and neither adds a test file, so
  nothing is wired up for them here. #39's `src/native/mesh_decode_validate.h`
  only includes the standard library, so its test can go straight into
  `tests/CMakeLists.txt` once #39 merges. KI-24's parsing and escaping live in
  `src/skate3_user_settings.cpp` next to SDK code and need moving into such a
  header first.

### KI-33: Hook addresses not gated on Title Update 3

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#27, tested in-game · was BT-26
- **Problem:** the game hooks use hard-coded guest addresses that are only
  correct in the Title Update 3 image, but the build still allowed codegen
  from the unpatched retail image. Release builds were never affected: they
  always use TU3.
- **Checked:** base-XEX codegen (retail `default.xex`,
  `config/skate3_functions.toml`) against the TU3 `generated/`, comparing each
  function's instruction stream with branch targets masked. TU3 shifts most
  code by about 0x24000 to 0x2B000 (for example the front-end state setter is
  `0x82CDFFB8` in retail, `0x82D0AFA0` in TU3). `src/` hooks or calls 90
  TU3 function addresses. 88 are not function starts in retail. The other
  two, `sub_82782818` and `sub_82B78FF0`, are different functions there,
  which is the silent wrong-hook case. The options menu, heap diagnostics and
  exception guard were already gated. The other 61 addresses were not: the
  native renderer, scene, draw-distance and demo-path hooks. Guest data
  addresses (globals, vtables) were not diffed. They sit behind the same
  gate now.
  The demo-path intro-movie codegen patch (`ApplySkate3CodegenPatches.cmake`)
  also anchors on TU3 addresses. The ultrawide frustum and FOV patches match
  instruction patterns instead.
- **Effect:** a retail build failed to link with
  `undefined reference to __imp__sub_...`, because each hook calls the
  original through a symbol the retail codegen doesn't emit. A reconfigure
  that lost the game root (and with it the TU3 fallback) produced the same
  error.
- **Fix:** configure now stops with an error that says how to provide TU3
  when no TU3 codegen input is found. A `static_assert` on
  `SKATE3_HAS_TITLE_UPDATE` at the top of each ungated hook block marks the
  addresses as TU3-only.
- **Leftover:** the retail-only branches (`#if !SKATE3_HAS_TITLE_UPDATE` in
  `src/skate3_app_common.cpp` and `src/exception_compat.cpp`, the
  retail `config/skate3_functions.toml`) are now unreachable.

### KI-34: Own the Spot / Own the Lot UI pops in and out or draws wrong

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#25. Confirmed in-game on
  D3D12 and Vulkan on 2026-10-12.
- **Symptom:** during Own the Lot (and Own the Spot) events the score and
  timer, objective text, challenge list and spot markers flickered in and out
  or drew incompletely. Native renderer only: the cause is in the native
  renderer's own vertex upload, so the emulated renderer (F5) is not affected.
- **Cause:** the in-world spline pass (the neon boundary/marker strips) and the
  HUD/2D pass share one per-frame upload region for their vertices, splines
  first. An Own the Lot boundary is up to 54 strips, about 1.03 MB, and the
  region was 1 MB. With the whole outline in view the spline pass filled it,
  so its last strip and every HUD draw after it were skipped without a log
  line (7 HUD draws skipped per frame in a measured run). The camera moving
  the outline in and out of view made the HUD pop in and out.
- **Fix:** the region (`RendererState::kUiRegionSize`,
  `skate3_native_scene_gpu_internal.h`) is now 4 MB, and the spline pass in
  `RenderScene` stops at `kUiSplineBudget`, 1 MB short of the end, so the HUD
  always has room. A skipped spline or 2D draw now logs a rolling-capped
  "UI vertex region full" warning.

### KI-35: Team-member portraits in character creation show old photos

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#26. Confirmed in-game on D3D12 and Vulkan on
  2026-10-12.
- **Symptom:** in Pause > Create Skater, the boxes of the extra team members
  showed photos from earlier events instead of each skater's portrait, a
  different old photo per member. The emulated renderer (F5) showed the same
  images because the portrait is saved with the team member. The bad members
  came from the career "new team member" prompt on the native renderer
  (v2.1.0).
- **Cause:** `SkaterPresentationPhoto` (request `sub_8278EE78`, render and
  extract step `sub_8278E960`) renders the skater into the postfx manager's
  1152x640 screenshot target, and `PhotoEffects::GeneratePhoto` CPU-reads that
  resolve from guest memory at 0x04911000 into the 128x256 portrait. That's the
  same surface the photo grab fills. On the native renderer the resolve only
  reached CPU memory when the pause-menu portrait window (suppress mode 3,
  picked by FE-stack heuristics in `YieldForMenus`) and the SDK's targeted
  0x04911000 copy (non-gameplay contexts only) both applied. The career prompt
  fell outside them, so the portrait was cut from whatever the last photo grab
  left there. Reproduced on main with
  `--skate3_native_render_scene_menu_rtt_passes=false`: take a photo, edit a
  member, and its portrait becomes that photo.
- **Fix:** hooks on the request and the step (`skate3_native_render.cpp`)
  drive `UpdateSkaterPhotoWindow` (`skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`). From the
  request until the step reports done, it holds suppress mode 3, synchronous
  shaders and the forced readback of resolves up to 0x2D0000, in any presence
  context. The native photo grab also stops writing 0x04911000 for that time.
  The log shows "skater photo window OPEN" and "skater photo generated (...
  window armed)". Existing bad portraits heal by editing the member once.
- **Emulated (F5), not fixed here:** in a gameplay presence context with
  `readback_resolve=none`, the emulated renderer would read the same stale
  memory (the SDK's targeted copy skips gameplay contexts). Not seen in play.

### KI-38: Frames-in-flight limit may skip frames only the native renderer draws

- **Status:** not a bug. No code change. Measured on `main` (f4d8500) with
  temporary logging, unattended, on D3D12 and Vulkan.
- **Suspicion:** rexglue-sdk's command processors only wait for a free frame
  (`kQueueFrames` / `kMaxFramesInFlight` = 3, in `BeginSubmission`) when a
  frame opens, and `EndSubmission` only closes a frame when `frame_open_` is
  set. If the native frame's `EndSubmission(true)` ran with no frame open, the
  GPU could fall any number of frames behind.
- **Why it can't happen:** `IssueSwap` on both backends calls
  `BeginSubmission(true)` before it calls the presenter's refresher ("in case
  the swap command is the only one in the frame"), and the Vulkan refresher
  calls it again. That opens the frame, and waits for the frame 3 back, even
  when every guest draw is suppressed. The native renderer runs inside the
  refresher, and nothing in the native RHI (`native_rhi_d3d12.cpp`,
  `native_rhi_vulkan.cpp`) ends a submission, so the frame is still open when
  the refresher's `EndSubmission(true)` closes it.
- **Measured:** temporary logging at the native `EndSubmission(true)` on both
  backends recorded `frame_open_` before the call and the frames whose closing
  submission the real fence hadn't reached yet (D3D12 `GetCompletedValue`,
  Vulkan `vkGetFenceStatus`). `--skate3_demo_path=true`, native renderer on,
  about 100 s of each run in gameplay. #28's upload-ring code was applied on
  top for the measurement.

  | Run | Native frames | `frame_open_` false | Frames in flight (max) | Frame time |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | D3D12, defaults | 25,200 | 0 | 1 (99.8%), 2 (51 frames) | 4.4 ms |
  | Vulkan, defaults | 26,400 | 0 | 1 (99.99%), 2 (1 frame) | 4.5 ms |
  | D3D12, GPU-bound | 7,800 | 0 | 3 in gameplay, never 4 | 15.9 ms |
  | Vulkan, GPU-bound | 9,600 | 0 | 3 in gameplay, never 4 | 12.9 ms |

  GPU-bound runs added `--resolution_scale=6
  --skate3_native_render_scene_msaa=8 --skate3_native_render_scene_ssr=true
  --skate3_native_render_scene_ssr_steps=64
  --skate3_native_render_scene_shafts_res=2
  --skate3_native_render_scene_ssao_full_res=true`. The cap holds at exactly
  3. #28's "upload ring <name>: K/N regions in flight" (logged at half the
  8-region ring or more) and "all N regions in flight" lines never appeared.
- **The "more than 3 frames behind" comment:** the bone-ring comment in
  `skate3_native_scene_gpu_internal.h` most likely counted submissions, not
  frames. Vulkan reached 6 submissions in flight while loading (several
  submissions per frame) with frames still at 3 or fewer. A ring keyed by
  frame number with 4 or more regions is never reused while the GPU reads it,
  so the hair and garment corruption that comment describes had some other
  cause.

### KI-28: Options menu edge cases

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#40, tested in-game on
  2026-10-28 · **Severity:** low · was BT-21
- **Where:** `src/skate3_options_menu.cpp`
- **Problem:** `StepRow` took `% count` with no guard for an empty label
  list (divide by zero), and the row value getter indexed `label_ids` with
  whatever the row's getter returned. `g_restart_popup_open` was set when the
  restart prompt opened and cleared only in its callback.
- **Cause:** the prompt reuses the Video Calibration popup's callback
  (`sub_8260EA48`), and the hook answered for the prompt whenever the bool
  was set. A screen can close a popup by id without calling its callback
  (`sub_82D0A628`), so the bool could stay set. The next Video Calibration
  answer would then have been treated as the restart prompt's: its first
  button would have applied the staged settings and restarted the game.
- **Fix:** the popup manager returns an id for each popup and passes it to the
  callback in r3, both for a button press (`sub_825EF698`) and when it flushes
  all its popups (`sub_82D0A738`, button -2). The hook now stores the
  prompt's id and answers only a callback carrying that id. Ids come from an
  ever-increasing counter, so a stale one never matches. Whether the prompt is
  open is read from the manager's popup queue (`PopupShown`), which also
  stops a second Back from stacking another prompt. A flush keeps the staged
  choices and the screen as they are. `StepRow` is a no-op for a row with no
  labels (no sound, input not consumed). The value getters show nothing
  for an out-of-range label. The number and string choice setters ignore
  out-of-range indices.
- **Tests:** a standalone check of the step and label logic (empty list,
  wrap, out-of-range getters, popup-id matching) passes. In-game, driven by
  `skate3_demo_path_gameplay_inputs` (Pause > Options tab > Game Settings >
  Graphics, step MSAA, Back): the prompt shows ("restart prompt shown"), B
  doesn't close it (it is A-only), Discard Changes logs button 1 and returns
  to Game Settings, and the PC rows still step afterwards. Restart Now logs
  button 0, applies the setting and relaunches. After a Discard, Video
  Settings > Video Calibration still opens the game's own calibration
  screens.
- **In-game test (user, D3D12, 2026-10-28):** three restart prompts answered
  with Discard, each returning the old value with rows still stepping. The
  Video Calibration popup that followed was correctly left to the game.
  Restart Now saved, exited cleanly and relaunched with MSAA 8x changed to 4x.
  Every row on Display, Graphics, View, PC Controls and System stepped
  correctly, including wrap-around.
- **Not tested:** a popup flush (button -2) while the prompt is up, and the
  Esc overlay opened over the prompt (it was opened just before one instead).

### KI-30: F12 dialog rewrites a cvar the render thread overrides

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#42, tested in-game on 2026-10-28 · **Severity:** low · was BT-23
- **Where:** `src/skate3_native_debug_dialog.cpp` (every section),
  `SdkCvarOverride` in `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`
- **Cause:** almost every control was written as
  `REXCVAR_SET(x, CvarCheckbox(..., REXCVAR_GET(x)))`, so each UI frame read
  the cvar and wrote it straight back, edit or not. `REXCVAR_SET` is a plain
  store, so a write by another thread that landed between the read and the
  write-back was undone. For `native_render_suppress_emulated_draws` that
  other writer is the render thread's `SdkCvarOverride` (KI-11). Undoing its
  forced value left the menu or photo window running without the override,
  because `Acquire` never writes again while held. Undoing its restore left the
  forced value in place after the window closed. The same pattern raced the
  options menu, the settings overlay, MAX QUALITY and the hotkeys on every
  other cvar in the dialog. The F5 checkbox read the cvar twice, so an F5
  press between the reads was toggled straight back.
- **Fix:** `CvarCheckbox`, `CvarSlider` and `ValueCombo` take the cvar's
  storage and write it only on the frame ImGui reports an edit. The sun
  override and F5 checkboxes use the `Checkbox` return value too. The
  controls that were already conditional (`SliderInt`, `Combo`, `InputInt`
  and the explicit `SliderFloat`s) are unchanged. While an override holds the
  suppress cvar, the dialog shows the user's value from the new
  `SdkCvarOverride::HeldView` (an atomic mirror of the saved value, through
  `native_scene::SuppressEmulatedDrawsOverride`), greys the box out and adds
  an "(overridden)" note. `Release` now logs a warning if the forced value
  was overwritten while held. MAX QUALITY's suspend and restore (KI-12) is
  unchanged. New debug cvar `skate3_native_debug_open_at_boot` opens F12 at
  startup for unattended runs.
- **Tested:** three unattended demo-path boots with F12 open from startup and
  `--skate3_native_render_scene_menu_unsuppress=true`, so the menu context
  holds the suppress override. The boot menu ("portrait window - suppress
  mode -> 3") and the pause menu showed the box ticked, greyed and
  "(overridden)". After resuming ("leaving menu context - emulated draw
  suppression restored") it was ticked and editable again. No "overwritten
  while held" warning in any run. Clicks can't be injected, so control edits
  and the F5 path ("SDK cvar overrides ... restored") were not exercised.
- **In-game test (2026-10-28):** user on D3D12: checkbox and slider edits (SSAO, Bloom, Dynamic shadows, bloom threshold, fly speed, MSAA 8x to 4x, shadow tile) stuck across closing and reopening F12; with F12 open during the Edit Skater photo, Suppress emulated draws showed greyed out and (overridden), portraits rendered correctly; F12 MAX QUALITY on and off three times maxed out and restored the user's settings each time; no 'overwritten while held' warning in the log.

### KI-23: OnShutdown missed several UnregisterBind calls

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#35, tested in-game on 2026-10-28
- **Problem:** `Skate3BaseApp::OnCreateDialogs` registers ten key binds, but
  `OnShutdown` only unregistered six. The screenshot bind (F6, captures
  `this`), the F5 renderer toggle, the Ctrl+Shift+B showcase bind and the End
  freecam bind stayed live. The SDK's bind registry is a process-lifetime
  static, so a key event reaching it after the app object was gone would call
  into a destroyed object.
- **Reach:** low in practice. The normal window close (and the overlay's Close
  Game on Windows/Linux) ends in `ReXApp::OnClosing`, which hard-exits before
  `OnDestroy`, so `OnShutdown` never runs there. It runs when the app quits
  through `QuitFromUIThread` or a failed `OnInitialize`: a cancelled or failed
  ISO / title update install, a `ConstructRuntime` failure, and Close Game on
  macOS.
- **Fix:** binds are registered through `RegisterAppBind`, which records each
  name; `OnShutdown` calls `UnregisterAppBinds`, which unregisters them all in
  reverse order before the dialogs they reach are reset, and logs
  "Skate 3 shutdown: unregistered N key binds". The SDK has no RAII bind
  handle. `UnregisterBind` only nulls the callback, so it is safe at any point
  in `OnShutdown` (the registry outlives the app, and `ReXApp::OnDestroy`
  calls `OnShutdown` before its own overlay teardown).
- **Tested:** relwithdebinfo build. A bogus `SKATE3_INSTALL_ISO` into an empty
  game root makes the installer fail and quit through `OnShutdown`: the log
  shows "unregistered 10 key binds", exit code 0, no WER report (the baseline
  build exits the same way without the line). `--skate3_demo_path=true` to
  gameplay, then WM_CLOSE: "Title terminated; hard-exiting process.", exit
  code 0, no WER report, same as baseline.
- **Not tested:** pressing the bind keys in this build (synthetic keys could
  not reach the unfocused window).
- **In-game test (2026-10-28):** user on D3D12, fullscreen: F6 saved a screenshot, F5 switched to emulated and back, End engaged and released freecam (422 guest SetViewMatrix rewrites), Esc > Close Game and Alt+F4 both logged 'Window closing' then 'Title terminated' with no crash dump.

### KI-32: Small cleanups

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#44, tested in-game on 2026-10-28 · **Severity:** low · was BT-25
- **Problems and fixes:**
  - Screenshots taken within the same second got the same filename, so the
    later save overwrote the earlier one. `ScreenshotPath`
    (`src/skate3_screenshot.cpp`) now writes
    `shot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_mmm[_tag].png`. The millisecond stamp is strictly
    increasing per process, so captures in the same millisecond still
    differ, and name order stays capture order.
  - `blur_tex` (popup blur, also the photo-grab source) was created once and
    never rebuilt, and `menu_blur_tex` was keyed on size only. Both now
    record the format they were built with and are recreated when the guest
    output format changes (`EnsureBlurOutlineTargets`,
    `src/skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`), like the blur PSOs. The guest output
    is a fixed R10G10B10A2 on both backends today, so this guards a future
    change; HDR on/off changes the scene format, not this one.
  - `kSceneRingFrames` is 2400 on purpose: the RB+A note says the dump is
    retroactive about 17 s, which is 2400 frames at 144 fps. The four
    "~900 frames" comments were stale and now say 2400.
  - `skate3_native_scene_state.h` (`MaybeDumpSceneRing`) now includes
    `<ctime>` and `<fstream>`. Compiled on its own, the old header failed on
    `std::ofstream`; the new one compiles.
- **Tested:** a unit check of the naming code (3000-name burst, 4 threads)
  found no duplicates and sorted order equal to capture order. Two
  unattended boots (HDR on, HDR off) ran the post sweep, which saved 7
  screenshots with the new names (up to three in one second), opened the
  pause menu with its popup blur showing, and logged no blur errors. The
  settings-overlay blur (`menu_blur_tex`, Esc/F1) needs a key press and was
  not exercised.
- **In-game test (2026-10-28):** user on D3D12, 4K fullscreen: five F6 presses within one second saved five files with distinct millisecond stamps (shot_20261028_211526_110 to _760); the Esc settings overlay and the pause-menu popup blur looked correct each time. The HDR-toggle recreate path was not exercised (the output format is fixed today).

### KI-17: Texture routing maps grew without bound

- **Status:** fixed in rubensteezy/skate3recomp#29, tested in-game on 2026-10-28 · **Severity:** low–medium · was BT-10
- **Area:** native renderer, texture cache
- **Problem:** `tex_routes`, `tex_sticky`, `words_sticky` and
  `tex_pending_first` were only cleared by the debug cache flush, so they grew
  for the whole session.
- **Fix:** every entry is stamped with `last_used_frame` when it is used, and
  `PruneTexRouting` (in `skate3_native_scene_gpu.cpp`, run right after
  `EvictTexStore`) sweeps the maps every 120 frames with the store LRU's idle
  guard (45 s of wall-clock time, never less than 8× the detail-downgrade
  hold). An idle route or sticky site is only dropped once its words key has
  no valid decode in the store, because then it serves the same thing a fresh
  entry would. Anything idle for 5 minutes goes regardless. An entry used this
  frame is never dropped, so the Edit Skater piece-signature hold (KI-2) and
  the streaming sticky serving (KI-1) keep their state while it matters.
- **Stats:** the `native-scene: tex routing pruned N (routes= sticky=
  words_sticky= pending_first= store=)` line logs at most once a minute when
  something was pruned. The perf log line (`skate3_native_render_scene_perf_log`)
  shows the sizes in `store[...]` too.
- **In-game test (2026-10-28):** user on D3D12, 4K, about 5.5 minutes: free roam with streaming showed no texture flicker or swaps, the replay editor kept a normal frame rate, and skin-tone and clothing edits in Edit Skater showed no wrong textures. The log showed three prune passes (67, 1 and 151 entries) with routes holding at about 1,400 to 1,500; tex_sticky still grew slowly (18,284 to 19,270), so whether it plateaus over a long session is not yet shown.

### Reviewed and ruled out (code review)

- Ultrawide target aspect persistence: not in the saved settings list.
- `BuildItemFromMesh` initialisation: items are always fresh.
- Photo FX MSAA latch: handled in `RenderScene`.
- Null hair PSOs: checked at the point of use.
